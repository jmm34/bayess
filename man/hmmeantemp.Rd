\title{
Metropolis-Hastings with tempering steps for the mean mixture posterior model%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
This function provides another toy illustration of the capabilities
of a tempered random walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm applied
to the posterior distribution associated with a two-component normal mixture with only its means
unknown (Chapter 7). It shows how a decrease in the temperature leads to a proper exploration of
the target density surface, despite the existence of two well-separated modes.

\usage{
hmmeantemp(dat, niter, var = 1, alpha = 1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{dat}{
%set to be modelled as a mixture%%     ~~Describe \code{dat} here~~
}
  \item{niter}{
number of iterations%%     ~~Describe \code{niter} here~~
}
  \item{var}{
variance of the random walk%%     ~~Describe \code{var} here~~
%     ~~Describe \code{var} here~~
}
  \item{alpha}{
temperature, expressed as power of the likelihood%%     ~~Describe \code{alpha} here~~
}
}
\details{
When \eqn{\alpha=1}{alpha=1} the function operates (and can be used) as a regular Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
}
\value{
sample of \eqn{\mu_i}{mu}'s as a matrix of size \code{niter} x 2
}
\examples{
